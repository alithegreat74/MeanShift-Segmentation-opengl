# Mean Shift Segmentation

This project implements the mean shift segmentation algorithm using a gaussian kernel. The project uses OpenGL shaders for parallel computing to achive realtime performance


## Mean Shift Algorithm
Mean Shift is a non-parametric clustering algorithm that identifies dense regions in data by iteratively shifting points toward the mode (peak) of their local density. For images, it smooths/blurs pixels while preserving edges by averaging neighboring pixels weighted by color similarity and spatial proximity. Key steps:

- Kernel: Define a window (radius) around each pixel.

- Weighting: Compute weights based on color/spatial distance.

- Shift: Move the window center to the weighted mean of neighbors.

- Repeat: Until convergence (no significant movement).
In image processing, itâ€™s used for tasks like denoising, segmentation, and creating painterly effects.

for better understanding of the mean shift algorithm please follow this great article by Bingyang [Mean Shift Segmentation](https://bbbbyang.github.io/2018/03/19/Mean-Shift-Segmentation/)


## How to run

To run this project on your computer you need to have CMake Installed. Once you installed cmake just run this command

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alithegreat74/MeanShift-Segmentation-opengl.git --recursive
  cd MeanShift-Segmentation-opengl
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
```

This is how it looks like with a 6*6 kernel and a max iteration of 5

## Thirdparty Libraries

- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for creating a context window to render in
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) for loading modern opengl functions
- [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for creating reacting debug window
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for loading textures


## How it Works

The way this project implements the MeanShift Algorithm is

- Create opengl context
- Create two framebuffers(we call them ping pong framebuffers)
- Load The input texture
- Create two texture with the same width and height as the input texture(we call them ping pong textures)
- render the basic input texture to the first framebuffer using a basic texture renderer shader
- Render the scene with the mean shift shader and go back and fourth with the ping pong shaders and texture n number of times
- render the output shader with the normal texture show shader
